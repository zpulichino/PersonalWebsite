                        <p>Spent five months working in the XCode IDE using Swift and SwiftUI to create an IOS Application. The app allowed for users to input their schedule for the month, and would then give them countdowns till their next event, as well as counting down how much time is left in their current event.  The app was intergrated with Microsoft's Project Scheduling API's to help improve functionality. The app only ever reached the beta stage being release to close friends and family for critque.</p>

                        <p>By intergrating Java's swing libraries to implement a graphical user interface, myself and a fellow collaborator developed an application which allowed for users to edit images uploaded from their computer. The application allowed for the user to upload any image type, and save the edit as an image type as well. By using the IntelliJ IDE, it took us a month to complete this project.</p>

                        <p>By using C, a fellow collaborator and I built and maintained a Linux Shell System. The system was constantly updated with memory allocation upgrades, new commands, and new supporting operators. The shell used forking in order to optimize the system.</p>
